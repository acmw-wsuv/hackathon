## Layout Considerations

### Overall concerns

* Check-in table
* Outlet locations
    * Talk to [the electrician](https://directory.vancouver.wsu.edu/people/dennis-giles) to ensure load is reasonably balanced
* Accessibility (paths, accessible tables)
* Entrance/exit points
    * Need to keep 6' away from a door per Fire Marshall

### Food

* How much food? -> table count/size
* Garbage location/count
* Table to eat at? Bistro tables?

### Team tables

* How many teams? -> table count
* Team size -> table size
* Electricity/network availability
* Extra chairs

### Presentations

* Don't forget about the podium and mic setup
* Table for prizes
* Ceiling projectors
* Chairs set up for presentation? Day 2 only?

### Sponsors

* How many?
* Booth, table, or just as presentation audience?
